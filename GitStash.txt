Git Stash:

se git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working
directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.

The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with git stash list, inspected with git stash show, and 
restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with git stash apply. Calling git stash without any arguments is equivalent 
to git stash push. A stash is by default listed as "WIP on branchname …​", but you can give a more descriptive message on the 
command line when you create one.
