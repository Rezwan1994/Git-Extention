Markdown Guide:

What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 
Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words 
and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add
Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

How Does it Work?

Dillinger makes writing in Markdown easy because it hides the stuff happening behind the scenes, but it’s worth exploring how the
process works in general.

When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. But then what? 
How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?

The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications
available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, 
all of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in 
web browsers.

Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to
take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined
with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.
